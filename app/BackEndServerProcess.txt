Setting up a very very simple backend server:
    + Move the whole React app into an 'app' folder.
    + Outside of that folder, initialize another package.json, which will cover the needs of server-side things.
    + Add a .gitignore and ignore node_modules.
    + npm install --save express cors
    + Start up the server by requiring those two, and using app.get to outline routes and custom responses.

Testing Route: 
    + Create a custom backend route with an obvious message. 
    + Install axios on the client side, and throw a request to the endpoint with the custom response, and log the response.

Proxying back end: 
    + Adding a proxy string to the package.json on the client-side ONLY works with fetch.
